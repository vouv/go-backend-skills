// Goroutine scheduler
// The scheduler's job is to distribute ready-to-run goroutines over worker threads.
//
// The main concepts are:
// G - goroutine.
// M - worker thread, or machine.
// P - processor, a resource that is required to execute Go code.
//     M must have an associated P to execute Go code, however it can be
//     blocked or in a syscall w/o an associated P.
//
// Design doc at https://golang.org/s/go11sched.

// Worker thread parking/unparking.
// We need to balance between keeping enough running worker threads to utilize
// available hardware parallelism and parking excessive running worker threads
// to conserve CPU resources and power. This is not simple for two reasons:
// (1) scheduler state is intentionally distributed (in particular, per-P work
// queues), so it is not possible to compute global predicates on fast paths;
// (2) for optimal thread management we would need to know the future (don't park
// a worker thread when a new goroutine will be readied in near future).
//
// Three rejected approaches that would work badly:
// 1. Centralize all scheduler state (would inhibit scalability).
// 2. Direct goroutine handoff. That is, when we ready a new goroutine and there
//    is a spare P, unpark a thread and handoff it the thread and the goroutine.
//    This would lead to thread state thrashing, as the thread that readied the
//    goroutine can be out of work the very next moment, we will need to park it.
//    Also, it would destroy locality of computation as we want to preserve
//    dependent goroutines on the same thread; and introduce additional latency.
// 3. Unpark an additional thread whenever we ready a goroutine and there is an
//    idle P, but don't do handoff. This would lead to excessive thread parking/
//    unparking as the additional threads will instantly park without discovering
//    any work to do.
//
// The current approach:
// We unpark an additional thread when we ready a goroutine if (1) there is an
// idle P and there are no "spinning" worker threads. A worker thread is considered
// spinning if it is out of local work and did not find work in global run queue/
// netpoller; the spinning state is denoted in m.spinning and in sched.nmspinning.
// Threads unparked this way are also considered spinning; we don't do goroutine
// handoff so such threads are out of work initially. Spinning threads do some
// spinning looking for work in per-P run queues before parking. If a spinning
// thread finds work it takes itself out of the spinning state and proceeds to
// execution. If it does not find work it takes itself out of the spinning state
// and then parks.
// If there is at least one spinning thread (sched.nmspinning>1), we don't unpark
// new threads when readying goroutines. To compensate for that, if the last spinning
// thread finds work and stops spinning, it must unpark a new spinning thread.
// This approach smooths out unjustified spikes of thread unparking,
// but at the same time guarantees eventual maximal CPU parallelism utilization.
//
// The main implementation complication is that we need to be very careful during
// spinning->non-spinning thread transition. This transition can race with submission
// of a new goroutine, and either one part or another needs to unpark another worker
// thread. If they both fail to do that, we can end up with semi-persistent CPU
// underutilization. The general pattern for goroutine readying is: submit a goroutine
// to local work queue, #StoreLoad-style memory barrier, check sched.nmspinning.
// The general pattern for spinning->non-spinning transition is: decrement nmspinning,
// #StoreLoad-style memory barrier, check all per-P work queues for new work.
// Note that all this complexity does not apply to global run queue as we are not
// sloppy about thread unparking when submitting to global queue. Also see comments
// for nmspinning manipulation.

// unlocks the stack by storing a valid stack head pointer.
//
// In order to make sure that there is always an m structure
